The CI Monitor is a place where all your project statuses come together.
Check if all tests have passed, and if deployments are successful. All
in one overview.

And if that's not enough for you, why not attach some epic hardware
that will represent the status of your projects! Attach a traffic
light, run marbles when a deployment is successful. The sky is the
limit!

# Features

* Push all your test/deployment statuses to a dashboard
* Hook up some epic modules to have fun with your statuses

# Available extensions

Of course you're able to add your own extensions as well, but why not
use some modules we already made for you?

Module | What does it do? | Link
------ | ---------------- | ----
MarbleRun | Run a (or multiple) marble(s) for every event you configured. | @todo
LedStrip | Display the status of your board with a led-strip. Red for a failure, orange for an active process, and green for success! | @todo
TrafficLight | Display the status of your board with a traffic light. Requires a green, orange and red light bulb. | @todo
PowerUp | Power a module for a couple of seconds for the events you configured. Maybe flash a beacon light for every status change? | @todo
