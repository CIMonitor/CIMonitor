# Compact mode

The compact modus is very interesting if you want to run CIMonitor in an iframe for a dashboard or
any other webpage.

## Preview

## Embedding

```html
<iframe src="YOUR CI MONITOR URL">
    <p>Your browser does not support iframes.</p>
</iframe>
```

**Note:** If your CIMonitor is running on an insecure http page, a page with your iframe with https will not
be able to display your CIMonitor. Make sure both are running on a secure https URL.
