The CIMonitor is a place where all your project statuses come together.
Check if all tests have passed, and if deployments are successful. All
in one overview.

![Dashboard example](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6495166/26701884/054927be-4723-11e7-9a2b-bee612c23942.png)

And if that's not enough for you, why not attach some epic hardware
that will represent the status of your projects! Attach a traffic
light, run marbles when a deployment is successful. The sky is the
limit!
