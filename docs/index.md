The CIMonitor is a place where all your project statuses come together.
Check if all tests have passed, and if deployments are successful. All
in one overview.

> version 2 screenshot coming soon

And if that's not enough for you, why not attach some epic hardware
that will represent the status of your projects! Attach a traffic
light, run marbles when a deployment is successful. The sky is the
limit!
