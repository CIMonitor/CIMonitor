The CIMonitor is a place where all your project statuses come together.
Check if all tests have passed, and if deployments are successful. All
in one overview.

And if that's not enough for you, why not attach some epic hardware
that will represent the status of your projects! Attach a traffic
light, run marbles when a deployment is successful. The sky is the
limit!
